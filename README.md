# Uni-Final-Year-Project

## University Final Year Project:
Arduino-Yun FTP Remote Control / Monitoring of Home
  
## Project Overview:
The concept of controlling devices at home by an Android phone and a microcontroller is implemented in this project. It presents the design of Home Automation with low cost and wireless remote control. Such automation can be used to aid the needs of elderly and disabled, saves energy and improves the standard of living at home.
‘Arduino-Yun FTP Remote Control / Monitoring of Home’ is designed to sense parameters like temperature, presence of gases, water, motion and humidity, and automate to switch ON or OFF devices like heaters, coolers, etc. The controller used is Arduino Yun and FTP protocol is enabled to communicate with an Android phone to monitor & control the sensor parameters.

## Aim: 
- Arduino Yun microcontroller measures certain parameters using the following sensors:
Temperature, Gas, Water, Motion and Humidity 
- User configured data is used by Arduino Yun to activate relays for heater/cooler &  LED lights.
- FTP protocol is enabled to communicate the data   with an Android phone which is used to monitor and control the sensor parameters.
- Future scope: It can be extended to remote controlling web cameras, telephones, answering machines, fax machines, amateur radios and other communications equipment, and home robots such as automatic vacuum cleaners.
